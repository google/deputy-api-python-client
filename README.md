# Deputy API Python Client

This is a Python3 client library for interacting with the
[Deputy.com api](https://www.deputy.com/api-doc/API/Getting_Started).

At best, it allows one to easily transcribe responses from the API into Python 
objects. At worst, it simplifies building and making queries to the API in a 
more object-oriented way.

This is not an official, or supported, Google product.
